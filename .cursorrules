# Docker Compose Rules
# All database and Rails commands should be run inside the Docker container using:
# docker compose exec app <command>

# Common commands:
# - Database migrations: docker compose exec app rails db:migrate
# - Rails console: docker compose exec app rails console
# - Rails server: docker compose exec app rails server
# - Bundle install: docker compose exec app bundle install
# - RSpec tests: docker compose exec app bundle exec rspec

# Available services:
# - app: Main Rails application (container_name: backstage-api)
# - db: PostgreSQL database (container_name: backstage-db)
# - redis: Redis server (container_name: backstage-redis)
# - sidekiq: Background job processor (container_name: backstage-sidekiq)
# - box: Bundle gems volume (container_name: backstage-bundle-box)

# Note: The application uses Docker Compose for development environment.
# Make sure all services are running with 'docker compose up' before executing commands.
